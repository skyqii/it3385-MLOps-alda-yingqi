# it3385 MLOps

In this assignment, we aim to build machine learning models (classification and anomaly detection) and deploy them using a web application. We build and deploy a front-end web application with realtime prediction and we set up development and deployment environment according to MLOps Lifecycle.

## Deployment

To run this project, installations needed:
```bash
  pip install flask
```
```bash
  pip install pycaret
```
```bash
  pip install hydra
```
```bash
  pip install poetry
```
DVC should be installed as an extension in Visual Studio Code.


### **Alda**
  1. Navigate to the Classification folder under /src
  2. Run the python alda_flask.py
  3. Open the webpage to input the values for prediction.
  4. Generate prediction to get the results.

### **Ying Qi**
  1. Navigate to the Anomaly Detection folder under /src
  2. Run the yq_app.py Python file in the Terminal.
  3. Open the server in the browser.
  4. Enter the values to predict, and get the results.
